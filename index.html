									<p>City Hospital is a well-respected institution in its
										community. However, the leadership team recognized
										a growing need to leverage data for better decision making. Traditionally, financial and operational
										decisions were made based on intuition and historical
										trends, which left room for inefficiencies and missed
										opportunities.City Hospital lacked a centralized view of their financial
										performance. This made it difficult to identify trends,
										optimize resource allocation, and make data-driven
										decisions. We were able to establish a logical structure for the
										hospitalâ€™s data and provided insights and recommendations on revenue generation, expenses and profitability.</p>
